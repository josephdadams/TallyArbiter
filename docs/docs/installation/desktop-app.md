# Desktop Application / Installer

## Installation

This is the easiest method and recommanded for users with less terminal experience. Just go to the [Releases](https://github.com/josephdadams/TallyArbiter/releases) page, grab the latest installer for Windows, MacOS or Linux, run it and you're ready to use TallyArbiter! After installation you can run it just like any other program.

## Upgrading

On Windows as well Linux the autoupdater is available. It will prompt you automatically once there is a new version available.

If you're running MacOS, there's unfortunately no way around manually [downloading the latest release](https://github.com/josephdadams/TallyArbiter/releases). This is due to Apple requiring apps to be signed in order for the autoupdater to work. For that, we'd need an Apple Developer Account which is about $100 a year which (as an open-source project) cannot afford. Maybe you want to sponsor us? 😉

**Be sure to back up or save your [config file](../usage/control-interface.md#configuration)!**
