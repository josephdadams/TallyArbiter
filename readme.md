## Documentation

All documentation can be found [here](https://josephdadams.github.io/TallyArbiter/docs/intro).

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. Here's a quick guide on how to setup your local development environment:

1. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). You need at least version `18.13`.
1. Make sure you have `npm@7`. This can be checked by running `npm -v`. If your version of `npm` is too old, update it using `npm i -g npm@7`
1. Clone this repository (or your fork): `git clone https://github.com/josephdadams/TallyArbiter`
1. Run `npm install` in the project's root folder
1. Start the main server with `npm start`
1. Make any code changes desired
1. Submit your work as a pull request

### UI

The UI lives in the `UI` folder and is written using Angular.

If you want to make changes to the UI, you need to do the following:

1. Navigate to the `UI` directory with `cd UI`
1. Install its dependencies with `npm install`
1. Start the local UI development server by running `npm start`.
1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

When you make changes to the source code, the page in your browser will automatically reload.

The socket&#46;io requests the UI makes are automatically proxied to `http://localhost:4455`. That's the reason why the main server (see above) needs to be running.

Running `npm install` in the project's root folder (not in the UI directory) the UI is built automatically. As the UI's bundled dist files are excluded from the git repository in the `.gitignore` file, this is needed to ensure users which install TallyArbiter from source also have bundled UI dist. This dist is also served by the main server using `express.static()`.

### Desktop App

The Desktop App is made with Electron. The main file is called [`main.js`](./main.js) (not to be confused with the [`index.js`](./index.js), which is the server's entrypoint.)

The Electron App can be started with `npm run desktop`. It will always show the generated UI dist, so in order to see changes made to the UI in the desktop app, you need to build the UI (see above).

The installer can be generated by running `npm run build-desktop`.
